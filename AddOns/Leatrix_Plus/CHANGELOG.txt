A Wowhead link will show in a copy-friendly window.  Press CTRL/C to copy the link then paste it into your browser.
- In the game key bindings menu, you can now set a keybind to toggle Leatrix Plus.  The 'Enable hotkey' command has been removed.

1.14.47 - 15th June 2022
- The 'Manage frames', 'Manage buffs' and 'Manage widget' settings ('Frames') now show a frame alignment grid when moving the frames (there is a button in each configuration panel to toggle the grid).  You can now drag the frames with the left button to position them freely or with the right button to position them using snap-to-grid.

1.14.46 - 8th June 2022
- For 'Show flight times', you can now change the position, scale and width of the flight progress bar using a new configuration panel.  You can also remove the progress bar background and destination text if you wish.  The flight progress bar is now noninteractive so you can click through it as if it isn't there.  If you wish to manually close the flight progress bar, there is a new Close Bar button in the configuration panel.  These new settings give you a lot of customisation options.  For example, if you set the width to the minimum, hide the background and hide the destination, you can have a neat little flight timer in the corner of the screen.

- Added flight times.  There are now 1041 flight times stored in Leatrix Plus for Classic Era/SoM.

1.14.37 - 6th April 2022

1.14.24 - 9th January 2022
- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points.

1.14.23 - 9th January 2022
- The 'Show flight times' option now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.

1.14.22 - 5th January 2022
- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.

1.14.21 - 29th December 2021
- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.

1.14.20 - 22nd December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.

1.14.19 - 18 December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.

1.14.18 - 17th December 2021
- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.

1.14.15 - 16th December 2021
- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).
- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.
- Updated the tooltip for 'Manage frames' ('Frames').

1.14.14 - 9th December 2021
- Fixed a few default UI minimap buttons for 'Enhance minima' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.

1.14.13 - 8th December 2021
- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).
- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.

1.14.12 - 2nd December 2021

1.13.63 - 13th May 2020
- Fixed an issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused a Lua error when looting an item with Master Looter enabled.  Rare caveat: After you slay a monster with Master Looter enabled, if you disable Master Looter before the loot has been assigned and then attempt to loot the same monster with Master Looter disabled, you may still see the error.  This is a rare exception though as you wouldn't normally disable Master Looter after slaying a monster until you have assigned loot so you will probably never see the error.

1.13.61 - 6th May 2020
- If 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') is enabled, automated resurrection will succeed even if there is a resurrection delay timer.

- The quest log frame for the 'Enhance quest log' option ('Interface') has been updated.  It now uses the game's built in double-wide texture rather than a custom texture.  If you use ElvUI, make sure it's up to date for the new quest log to work properly.
