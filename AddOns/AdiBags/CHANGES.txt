    * Fix for Season of Discovery custom max levels per phase
    
    _G.MAX_PLAYER_LEVEL is set to the max level for the phase after a /reloadui in game. When logging in initially it is 60 but after reloading or changing zones the change causes a LUA error every time the bags are opened.
    
    * Update Classic Era TOC version
