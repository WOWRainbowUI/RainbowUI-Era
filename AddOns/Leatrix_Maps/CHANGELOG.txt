- If you are not using 'Use default map', the map size has changed with this update.

1.13.43 - 8th January 2020
- Added a new option 'Auto change zones'.  If enabled, when your character changes zones, the map will automatically change to the new zone unless you have manually selected a different map zone.  Example, moving from Elwynn Forest to Westfall while the map is showing Elwynn Forest, the map will automatically change to Westfall.  However, moving from Elwynn Forest to Westfall while the map is showing Arathi Highlands, the map will not automatically change.  This allows you to browse various maps without it constantly changing back to the map your character is in.  This option can be especially useful if you are using the 'Sticky map frame' option (though 'Sticky map frame' is not required to use 'Auto change zones').

1.13.42 - 1st January 2020

- Added a new setting to the 'Set map opacity' configuration panel which, if enabled, will cause the map to use the stationary opacity setting while pointing at the map even if your character is moving.  It's enabled by default.
- Added missing flight point in Rut'theran Village, Teldrassil (Alliance).
- The dungeon icon for Blackrock Mountain (shown in the Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes maps) now uses a hybrid dungeon/raid design to make it clear that the mountain is host to both dungeons and raids.
