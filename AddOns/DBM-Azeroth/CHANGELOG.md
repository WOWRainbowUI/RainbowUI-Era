- reduce transparency of dropdown menus to make it easier to read options in them. With recent UI updates, background tect in many places changed from a softer yellow to a strong white, as a result it could be difficult to read dropdown items in sound and timer color menus. This balances that out.  
- re-arrange, at least in the languages that actually have dropdown localizations  
- I didn't like how unclear this is, so make it clearer that the default 4 sounds selected in sound drop downs, are the global sounds (as configured in the special announce panel)
