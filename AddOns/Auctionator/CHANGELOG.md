[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Auctionator/Auctionator/compare/10.2.9...10.2.10) 

- Reword tooltip options  
- Disable different item price matching on retail, leaving it classic only  
- Classic: For equipment match prices using "of the" suffix (along with ilvl)  
    This affects retail, but retail users shouldn't notice any difference
